<!-- Introduction -->
Welcome to the world of smart coding! ðŸš€ In this article, we're diving into an exciting project that combines the power of **Codeforces** and **Docker** with IoT to bring real-time feedback to your coding journey. Introducing the **Codeforces Lamp**, a cutting-edge solution designed for developers and competitive programming enthusiasts who want to elevate their coding experience with interactive and visual feedback.

# Setting Up Your Codeforces Lamp: Real-time Programming Feedback with Docker and IoT

## Why Codeforces Lamp?

Have you ever wished for instant feedback on your programming submissions without having to check your screen constantly? Or perhaps you wanted a more engaging way to track your Codeforces ratings? The Codeforces Lamp project is here to make that wish a reality. By integrating with the Codeforces API, this project provides visual feedback through a smart lamp that responds to your profile's rating and submission status.

## How It Works

The Codeforces Lamp project utilizes a smart lamp connected to the internet to display real-time feedback based on your Codeforces activity. Here's how it all comes together:

1. **Integration with Codeforces API**:
   - Fetches real-time data on profile ratings and submissions.
   - Analyzes submission statuses to trigger appropriate lamp responses.

2. **Dockerized Solution**:
   - The entire application runs within a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability.
   - Pre-configured environment ensures all dependencies and configurations are in place.

3. **IoT and Smart Lamp Interaction**:
   - Utilizes Tuya's IoT APIs to communicate with smart lamp devices.
   - Adjusts lamp colors based on coding activities:
     - **In-Process Submissions**: Lamp flickers with a breathing orange effect.
     - **Accepted Submissions**: Lamp turns parrot green as a celebration.
     - **Wrong Submissions**: Lamp displays a red alert.

## Features

The Codeforces Lamp project offers a variety of features designed to enhance your coding experience:

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instantaneous visual responses to your Codeforces activities.
- **Pre-configured Docker Environment**: Simplifies setup and eliminates the need for manual configurations.
- **Modular Architecture**: Allows for easy extension and customization according to user preferences.
- **Open Source and Community Driven**: Freely available for everyone to use, modify, and contribute to.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with the Codeforces Lamp project, make sure you have the following:

- **SMARTLIFE App**: Available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuya.smartlife&hl=en_IN) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/smart-life-smart-living/id1115101477).
- **Wipro [Smart Lamp/Light Devices](https://amzn.to/3zKYso2)**: Compatible smart light devices for interaction.
- **Tuya Developer Access**: Required for interacting with Tuya's IoT APIs.
- **Codeforces API Key**: Obtainable from the Codeforces website for API access.

## Setting Up the Codeforces Lamp

Follow these simple steps to set up the Codeforces Lamp and start receiving real-time feedback:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanisntsolo/codeforces-lamp.git
cd codeforces-lamp
```
### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

```yaml
- CODEFORCES_API_KEY=${CODEFORCES_API_KEY}
- CODEFORCES_API_SECRET=${CODEFORCES_API_SECRET}
- TUYA_ACCESS_ID=${TUYA_ACCESS_ID}
- TUYA_ACCESS_KEY=${TUYA_ACCESS_KEY}
- TUYA_BULB_ID=${TUYA_BULB_ID}
```
### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t codeforces-lamp .
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container
