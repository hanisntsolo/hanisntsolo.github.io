# _**Getting Started with WLED on ESP8266**_

Are you ready to dive into the world of LED magic? With WLED and an ESP8266 microcontroller, you can create stunning light displays with ease. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started.

## Why WLED?

WLED is an open-source software that brings life to your LED strips. Unlike regular LEDs, WLED allows individual control over each LED, enabling mesmerizing patterns and effects.

## What You Need

1. **ESP8266 Dev Board**: The brain of your project. [Buy here](https://amzn.to/ESP8266).
2. **WS2812B LED Strip**: Individually addressable RGB LEDs. [Buy here](https://amzn.to/WS2812B).
3. **Jumper Wires**: Essential for connections. [Buy here](https://amzn.to/jumper-wires).
4. **Micro USB Data Cable**: For power and data transfer. [Buy here](https://amzn.to/micro-usb-cable).
5. **USB Wall Charger**: To power your setup. [Buy here](https://amzn.to/usb-wall-charger).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Flashing WLED on ESP8266

1. **Download NodeMCU PyFlasher**: [Get it here](https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher/releases).
2. **Get WLED Firmware**: [Download the latest version](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases).
3. **Flash Firmware**:
   - Connect ESP8266 to your computer.
   - Open NodeMCU PyFlasher, select the USB port, and the WLED firmware `.bin` file.
   - Click `Flash NodeMCU`.

### Connecting LEDs to ESP8266

1. **Disconnect power** before wiring.
2. **Connect wires**:
   - **Red (5V)**: to `Vin` pin.
   - **Black (Ground)**: to `GND` pin.
   - **Green (Data)**: to `D4` pin.
3. **Reconnect power** and watch the LEDs light up.

### Configuring WLED

1. **Connect to WLED WiFi**:
   - Find the `WLED-AP` network and connect with password `wled1234`.
   - Configure your local WiFi settings for seamless control.

### Using the WLED App

1. **Download the WLED app**:
   - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wled/id1475695033)
   - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aircoookie.WLED)
2. **Discover and control your lights** via the app, exploring various patterns and effects.

## Enhance Your Setup

Integrate WLED with SmartThings and webCoRE for automated lighting, or explore advanced configurations with MQTT, Alexa, and more.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've set up WLED on your ESP8266, creating a customizable and dynamic lighting solution. Dive into the WLED community, experiment with new projects, and illuminate your world.
