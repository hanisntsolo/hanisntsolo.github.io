<!-- Introduction -->
The **Auto-Committer** is a Dockerized Python application that automates the process of committing and pushing changes to a Git repository at regular intervals. This tool is designed to keep your repositories up-to-date without manual intervention, ensuring that your codebase remains current with minimal effort.


## Features

- **Automatic Commits:** Regularly commits and pushes changes to a specified Git repository.
- **Configurable Intervals:** Set the interval at which commits are made.
- **Logging:** Tracks commit activities and errors in a log file.
- **Dockerized:** Easily deployable with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
1. Docker
2. Docker Compose
3. Git

## Installation
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanisntsolo/auto-committer.git
cd auto-committer
```

## Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following variables:
```env
AUTO_COMMIT_REPO_PATH=/path/to/your/repository
COMMIT_SPECIFIC_DIRECTORY=/path/to/directory
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
LAB_REPO_OWNER=your_github_username
LAB_REPO_NAME=your_repository_name
COMMITTER=your_name
USEREMAIL=your_email@example.com
USERNAME=your_username
COMMIT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600
LAB_LOG_FILE_PATH=/path/to/your/logfile.log
```

## Build and Run the Application:
```bash
./rebuild_and_run.sh
or
sh rebuild_and_run.sh
```

## Usage
The application runs in a Docker container and commits changes to the specified Git repository at the interval defined in the environment variables.
Logs are saved to the file specified by LAB_LOG_FILE_PATH.
Docker Compose Configuration
Build the Docker image:

The docker-compose.yml file defines the service configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  commiter_app:
    build: .
    restart: always
    container_name: auto-committer
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 512M
    ports:
      - "5009:5009"
    environment:
      - AUTO_COMMIT_REPO_PATH=${AUTO_COMMIT_REPO_PATH} #Directory which needs to setup as auto commit
      - COMMIT_SPECIFIC_DIRECTORY=${COMMIT_SPECIFIC_DIRECTORY} #Directory which needs to setup as auto commit
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN} # your github PAT(Personal Access Token)
      - LAB_REPO_OWNER=${LAB_REPO_OWNER} # usually github username
      - LAB_REPO_NAME=${LAB_REPO_NAME} # repo name
      - LAB_LOG_FILE_PATH=${LAB_LOG_FILE_PATH} #log file path
      - COMMITTER=${COMMITTER} # name of the commiter 
      - USEREMAIL=${USEREMAIL} # github user email
      - USERNAME=${USERNAME} # github username
      - COMMIT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600 # commit interval
    volumes:
      - ${COMMIT_SPECIFIC_DIRECTORY}:/${COMMIT_SPECIFIC_DIRECTORY} # volume mapping for the docker container to be able to access the repo from inside the container.
```
Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
# Install Git
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY auto_committer.py auto_committer.py

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5009

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "auto_committer.py"]
```
## Troubleshooting
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
2. Verify that the .env file is correctly configured.
3. Check the log file specified by LAB_LOG_FILE_PATH for any errors.
